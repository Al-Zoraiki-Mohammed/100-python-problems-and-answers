## Python  problems and answers for beginners :) 

* The file 'Task.docx' contains some collected  problems, mainly taken from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and I put my code/solution for each problem  in a separate python script named with the same name as the task.
* Some answers mait be not professional but it is still correct and considered to be beginner-friendly.
